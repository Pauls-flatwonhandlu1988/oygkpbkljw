Wow, just walked out of watching Ad Vitam and, boy, my brain feels like it's been on a rollercoaster ride through a techno-underground rave mixed with a philosophy lecture. I mean, what even was that? It's like someone took immortality, chucked it in a blender with existential dread, and added a soundtrack that’s 70% weird whale noises. Seriously, can we talk about those soundscapes? They’re like if my dishwasher decided to try sneaking into a rave.

I’m slightly tired, my eyes are sore from staring at the screen for what feels like eons (or maybe I’m just getting old, who knows). Caught somewhere between feeling fascinated and, honestly, a bit annoyed. There’s something about the film's world that’s all shiny and brittle, like it’s made of glass — really fragile, you know? I mean, who thought making people live forever was a good idea? I can barely keep my Tamagotchi alive. And the whole vibe? A cocktail of Blade Runner vibes meets a philosophy student's fever dream.

> Speaking of fever dreams, the characters, did they go to the same acting school as those who think eyebrows are the only form of expression? The lead actor's eyebrows did some heavy lifting. Not bad, just amusing. Like, maybe they deserve their own award. 

And oh my god, the visuals. It's like someone with ADHD designed a world where neon and melancholy had this awkward one-night stand. So, it kind of sticks with you. One scene with the ocean was genuinely pretty, made me think of my last beach trip, except this beach had a side-serving of question-your-existence. I laughed inappropriately at times. But maybe that’s just my thing. 

Random thought: is it just me, or did this feel like the cinematic equivalent of liking pineapple on pizza? You’re confused if you wanted this thing, but you can't stop pondering the quirky combo.

Here’s something off the cuff:  

```csharp
public class Immortality {
    public bool IsDesirable { get; set; } = false; 
}
```

I slapped that in because...reasons? Suddenly feel this odd urge to download the movie, watch the movie again alone in fragile moments at 3 a.m., because clearly it carved a little corner in my brain.

So yeah, Ad Vitam. I'm kind of stuck on it. It’s a gorgeous, maddening portrait of forever that sort of feels like biting into a microwaved apple —unexpected, kinda confusing, but maybe worth a second go...or not. I’ll let you know after I sleep on it. Or...immortalize it in my dreams.
